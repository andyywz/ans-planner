This is an app I am using to learn some of the basics of React. 

Eventually, these are the intended functionalities:
- Allow users to login
- Allow users to view information about events
- Allow users to RSVP
- Allow users to subscribe to notifications from the event planner

The stack that will be used is MERN (MongoDb, Express, React, NodeJS).
